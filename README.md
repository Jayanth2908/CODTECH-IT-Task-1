## Overview of the Project
### Project: SIMPLE CALCULATOR

### Project Description:
This project aims to develop a basic calculator using Java that can perform fundamental arithmetic operations. The user will input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The program will then execute the chosen operation and display the result.

### Tools and Technologies:
**Java Development Kit (JDK):** The primary tool for writing and compiling Java programs.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans will be used for coding and debugging.

**Java Standard Library:** Utilized for input/output operations and basic arithmetic calculations.

## Key Activities:

**Project Setup:**
Install Java Development Kit (JDK).
Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

**Program Design:**
Define the structure of the calculator.
Plan the user interface for input and output.

**Coding the Calculator:**
Create a Java class for the calculator.
Implement methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Write code to handle user input and output.

**User Input and Validation:**
Use Scanner class for capturing user inputs.
Validate inputs to ensure they are numerical and handle any exceptions for invalid inputs.

**Performing Calculations:**
Implement the logic to perform the selected arithmetic operation based on user input.
Ensure division by zero is handled appropriately.

**Displaying Results:**
Output the result of the operation to the user.
Provide options for the user to perform another calculation or exit the program.

**Testing and Debugging:**
Test the calculator with different inputs and operations.
Debug any issues and ensure the program runs smoothly.
